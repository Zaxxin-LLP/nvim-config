What is this?
A very simple, and also unintuitive, incomplete nvim config that would soon grow. A lot of copy-and-pasting, but I always make sure that I understand how it works, before moving on or pasting it.
I have no intention of making this contributable, plus why would you even want to contribute to this?

/*** Add. Info ***/
- Too lazy and busy to put an LSP even though I probably should to make it easier for myself.
- Modules... don't even know whether it works. That sub-module thingy. I know people have implemented better ways, but thats the way I thought of, so might as well.
- The lua indentation is weird. Probably have to look into it.

Plans
- Practice with Lua a little more so I can understand it more easier, and probably fix some of my other code. Would take a while as im learning C at the same time. Maybe fiddle with the lua C API?
- Remove the errors, and remove the prints and debugs that I randomly placed around in my modules.
- More... in the future.
